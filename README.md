### pandas Part 1 – Introduction to Pandas
Pandas is a Python module that builds on top of numpy and is used to deal with data in a comfortable way. Many of its features and operations should quickly become familiar to you if you use some database programs or spreadsheets. With pandas you can manipulate structured data, which can be easily labeled.

### pandas Part 6 – the Index Class
In the previous parts of this series we discussed two of the three fundamental data types in pandas, the Series and the DataFrame. In this part we'll be talking about the third one, the Index.

### pandas Part 10 – Operations on Data
Pandas makes it easy to operate on data. In case of unary operations index and column labels are preserved. In case of binary operations indices are aligned.
